Project Description:

The all famous Dice Game also known as Pig Game, a very popular game for coding beginners to attempt to write. I wrote this game more than once starting with simple Javascript and now finishing with this version using react and some 3D css effects for styling. The game has two players, player 1 starts the game by rolling the dice. Player can roll the dice as many times he/she wants or as long as he/she does not roll 1. If rolled 1 the player loses the match score and the game turn is passed to the other player. Each player has the ability to save match score and add the points to total game score. After saving match score the game turn is passed to the other player. The goal is to reach the winning total score (in this case it is 100) before the other player.
